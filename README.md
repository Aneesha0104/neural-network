Implementing Black and White Box Neural Networks for the same dataset and interpreting its results.

# What is White Box and Black Box Neural Networks?

White Box models:

Black Box models are self created models. These models help you understand the code better but not in terms of the data.

Black Box models:

Black Box models are created with the help of packages like tensorFlow, Keras etc. These models help you understand the dataset better but wont't help you to understand the code cuurectly.

# Description of the Dataset:

This dataset is consist of basic practices or symptoms that lead to lung cancer. 

It consists of 16 attribute , where 1 is the target feature which needs to be predicted.

The objective is to classify whether a given person has a lung cancer or not.

# Activation Function Used:

I used Sigmoid as the activation function cause it is easier to calculate partial differential with respect to sigmoid function because of the presence of an exponential.

Comparion of Black-Box and White Box results:
Accuracy of :

Black Box : 95.69

White Box : 93.13

The black box models simply performs better than the white box model due to its more efficient and modular code.
